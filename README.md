# Quantum-Solver

The program solves the time-independent Schrödinger equation using the three-point finite difference method, offering a versatile tool for exploring quantum mechanics in various potentials. 
Users can analyze systems such as Finite Well, Harmonic Oscillator, Poschl-Teller, Double Finite Well, and Superlattice, gaining insights into the behavior of quantum particles in different 
potential landscapes.

## Getting Started

To get started with the program, follow these steps:

1. **Download the repository:**
   - Click on the "Code" button above and choose "Download ZIP" to download the repository as a zip file.

2. **Unzip the downloaded folder:**
   - Unzip it to your preferred location on your local machine.

3. **Navigate to the project directory using your preferred terminal or command prompt. For example:**

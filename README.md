# Numerical-Solution-of-the-Time-Independent-Schrodinger-Equation-With-Python

The program solves the time independent schrodinger equation using the three point finite difference method in different potentials. 
The potentials solved are the following: 
Finite Well, 
Harmonic Oscillator, 
Poschl-Teller,
Double Finite Well, 
Superlattice.
